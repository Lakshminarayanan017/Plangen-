"""
grid_plan.py — the wall-graph substrate.

A GridPlan is an ownership grid on the 1.5" lattice: every cell belongs to
exactly one of {OUTSIDE, WALL, a room}. Rooms are never *placed* — space is
*split* by inserting wall bands. Because ownership is exclusive by array
construction, overlap and gaps are unrepresentable, at every step, forever.

Derived views (shared walls, adjacency, clear dimensions) are computed from
the grid — the grid is the single source of truth. Openings (doors / wide
openings) are metadata anchored to shared-wall runs; the wall band itself
stays in the grid (structurally a wall with a gap, like the partial walls
between kitchen/dining/drawing in real Indian plans).

v0 scope: rectilinear plans, rectangular faces (guillotine splits produce
T-junctions across siblings naturally). Irregular plot polygons rasterize
onto the same lattice later without changing this model.
