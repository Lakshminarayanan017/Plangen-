contracts.py — typed interfaces between engine tiers.

Every tier speaks ONLY these types. A tier can be swapped (statistical
fallback ↔ trained model) without any other tier noticing. Contracts carry
floor context from day 1 even though multi-floor realization is deferred —
retrofitting contracts later rots the orchestrator (engine doc §8.5).

Requests validate themselves (`EngineRequest.problems()` / `.validate()`)
and round-trip through dicts so the harness can store briefs as JSON.
Engine behavior knobs live in EngineConfig, not scattered constants.
