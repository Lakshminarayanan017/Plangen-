"""
fallbacks.py — statistical-prior twins of the ML tiers.

The engine must run end-to-end BEFORE any model is trained, and must
degrade gracefully when a trained tier is unavailable or low-confidence.
This is the all-algorithmic Tier-2: an affinity-aware zone-prior proposer.

Beyond raw zone depths it encodes real architectural priors:
  • hub rooms (dining/hallway) seed at the plot's across-center — the
    free-space connector position
  • wet rooms seed BESIDE their affinity target (bathroom next to a
    bedroom, utility/store next to the kitchen) so the carver lands them
    adjacent and the connector can door them correctly
  • anchors are placed center-out by size (big rooms get prime positions)

The trained Tier-2 placer replaces this class behind the same contract;
its merge gate is beating this proposer on the harness (engine doc §7).
