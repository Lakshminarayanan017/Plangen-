"""
multifloor.py — plan a building, not a floor.

Floors are generated bottom-up, each one CONDITIONED on the one below,
because the vertical constraints are not preferences: the stair must land in
the same cells, the drainage stacks want to line up, and the partitions want
something under them. Generating floors independently and hoping they agree
produces two plans that cannot be built as one house.

The conditioning is applied where it belongs — at the PROPOSER. A
`FloorConditionedProposer` wraps any Tier-2 proposer (prior or trained) and:

  • pins the staircase seed to the stair below (hard: VRT-001 depends on it)
  • pulls wet rooms toward the wet cells below (soft, `vertical_bias`)

Everything downstream is unchanged, so the carver, settler, reviewer and the
stair fitter treat an upper floor exactly like a ground floor. After each
floor is chosen, engine/vertical.py reviews it against the floor below and
a floor whose vertical verdict has hard violations is rejected in favour of
the next-best candidate — the same "generate several, keep what survives"
discipline the single-floor engine already uses.

    flight from below arrives.

    `previous` is the GROUND FLOOR of the plan an edit is changing. It applies
    to floor 0 only, and that is not a limitation — floor 0 is the only floor
    with a free choice. Every floor above is planned against the one below

    would fight the vertical rules that make it buildable.

    a different building — and G+1 is the common case for the users this is
