"""
connections.py — automatic connection typing (the openness gradient)
plus fenestration (windows) and the whole-house connectivity guarantee.

Real plans breathe through a gradient: social rooms merge into each other
through doorless wide openings (the partial walls of the reference plan);
private and service rooms close behind door leaves; some pairs stay sealed.
This module applies that gradient as RULES over the final adjacency graph —
no wish lists — then guarantees the house works:

  1. main entrance door through the exterior wall (entrance room priority)
  2. rule-typed openings on qualifying shared walls
  3. reachability repair: any room not reachable from the entrance through
     openings gets a door to its best reachable neighbor (social side
     preferred — privacy), or the candidate dies honestly
  4. windows on exterior walls: habitable rooms sized toward NBC
     ventilation ratios, wet rooms get small ventilators

Kitchen NEVER receives a door — wide openings only (user quality bar).
The public functions are reused by the engine's repair module.
